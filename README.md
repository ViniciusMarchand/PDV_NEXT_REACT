## POS project
This project is a point-of-sale (POS) system developed using modern technologies to ensure a smooth and efficient user experience. Below are the main technologies and libraries used in the project.

Technologies used
Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility framework for styling that allows you to create customized layouts quickly and efficiently. Using a utility-first approach, it provides a quick way to style components and create responsive, attractive designs without the need to write custom CSS. In the project, Tailwind CSS is used to style the front-end of the POS system, ensuring a modern, responsive design and allowing the creation of consistent, customizable user interfaces with less CSS code.

Next.js: Next.js is a React framework for building modern web applications. It offers features such as server-side rendering (SSR), static page generation (SSG) and support for API routes, making it ideal for high-performance web applications. In the project, Next.js is used to build the POS front-end application, taking advantage of its server-side rendering features to improve performance and SEO, and facilitating the creation of routes and integration with APIs.

Component Design Libraries: Component design libraries provide sets of reusable, stylized components that make it easy to build consistent, well-designed user interfaces. Examples include shadcn. In design, these libraries are used to create and style user interface components, such as buttons, forms and modals, which are essential for POS functionality.
